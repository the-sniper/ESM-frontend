    <span class="text-small" style="color:hsl(0,0%,0%);"><span><strong>"98+ out of 100 ...</strong> I was able to taste the 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Cuvée Chaupin on two occasions, rating it one point higher on one of those as well. Incredible notes of red and black fruits, violets, scorched earth, ground pepper, and Provençal garrigue notes define the nose, and it’s a darker, richer, slightly more powerful wine than usual, while still showing the inherent elegance and finesse this cuvée always shows. Give bottles 2-3 years and enjoy over the following 15-20. Don’t miss it!"<strong> - Jeb Dunnuck, JebDunnuck.com (11/2021)</strong></span></span>

    <span class="text-small" style="color:hsl(0,0%,0%);"><span>The history of Janasse traces back to the late 1960s when Aimé Sabon returned from military service to his family's vineyards in Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the view that there should be more control over the final product rather than selling grapes to the local cooperative as his father had previously done. By 1973 Sabon had built his own vat room and cellar which allowed the family to oversee all levels of production and thus join the upper echelon of winemaking estates in the Southern Rhône. Recently, the torch has been passed down to the next generation, with Christophe and Isabelle Sabon in charge of the day-to-day operations, and quality has never been better. A bevy of high-90s and 100-point scores have been awarded to top-end cuvées from Janasse over the last decade, with the 2019 Chaupin once again being among the best dollar-for-dollar wines you can find in Châteauneuf-du-Pape.&nbsp;</span></span>
